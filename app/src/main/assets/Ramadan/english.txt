I intend to keep the fast for the month of Ramadan.
O Allah! I fasted for You and I believe in You (and i put my trust in you) and I break my fast with Your sustenance.
O Allah! forgive and have mercy and you are the best of merciful.
I seek Allah's forgiveness for all my sins, Who is Lord, and I ask for repentance.
Allah save us from the hell's fire.
"Glory be to the Owner of the Kingdom of the earth and the heavens. Glory be to He who commands Respect and Honour and Magificence & Awe and Power and Greatness and Omnipotence. Glory be to the Sovereign, the Ever-living. Who does not sleep nor die. He is the Most Praised, the Most Holy, Our Lord and the Lord of all the Angels and the Spirit (Jibraeel A.S) O Allah! Save us from the Fire of Hell. O Protertor! O Protertor! O Protertor!"
